black-box classifiers using network analysis techniques]().

At current state, the software may have some bugs.

### Requirements
The software is developed in Python 3. You can find a list of all the packages required in *requirements.txt*. The GUI is developed with PyQt6.

### Usage
The software has two parts:
* Feature Relevance computation;
* Sensitivity computation.

You can find all the relevant information in the linked paper.

NAFER saves all the values computed in CSV files inside the project folder.
